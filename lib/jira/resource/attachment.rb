    # == Lifecycle methods
    #
    # === Retrieving a single attachment by Issue and attachment id
    #
    #     # Find attachment with id 30076 on issue SUP-3000.

    #     attachment = issue.attachments.find do |attachment_curr|
    #         30076 == attachment_curr.id.to_i
    #     end
    #
    # === Retrieving meta information for an attachments
    #
    #     attachment.meta
    #
    # === Retrieving file contents of attachment
    #
    #     content = URI.open(attachment.content).read
    #     content = attachment.download_contents
    #     content = attachment.download_file { |file| file.read }
